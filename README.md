# vue-social-support

Vue.js component for your visitors and customers to send messages directly to you through social chats or customized form.

`vue-social-chat` allows your customers to open a conversation from your website directly to chat apps like **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, **Messenger**, **WeChat**, **Line**, **Viber** or even the same **custom form**.

Most people use a chat app, so offering your customer a form of direct contact helps you cover visitors to customers, as well as providing you with **leads** to increase your sales or spread your content.
